Welcome to rough-scaled python
==============================

Tools to analyse rough boundary in quasi-one dimensional systems for python.

To clone this repository do
```
git clone git@github.com:ottodietz/rough-q1d.git
```
You might want to add the following line to your ~/.bashrc, to add rough-q1d to your module search-path:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<PATH TO GIT CLONE>/rough-q1d
```

Then you can import all functions via 

```
import q1d
```

all other files, are imported in q1d.py.

### Files

```
q1d.py: main module file. All q1d_* files are imported in here.
q1d_loc_length.py : functions for calculate localization length 
q1d_step.py: functions for analyzing step-like rough boundaries
q1d_smooth.py: functions for analyzing smooth rough boundaries
q1d_utils.py: utility functions
q1d_other_fft_implementations.py: not in use.
q1d_joerg_merge.py: will be integrated to the other files above.
```
